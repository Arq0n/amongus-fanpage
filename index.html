                        Red is generally considered the "sus" character in 
                        Among Us. They are systematically "sus" and should 
                        be kept track of.

                        While Red is considered the "sus" of the bunch, Green 
                        is usually the imposter. Beware of Green when you 
                        encounter them.

                        Won't ever shut up. Constantly talking even though 
                        nobody can hear them and their info is generally 
                        useless. Always vote them off first.
