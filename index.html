                        Red is generally considered the "sus" character in 
                        Among Us. They are systematically "sus" and should 
                        be kept track of.

                        is usually the imposter. Beware of Green when you 
                        encounter them.

                    Have your heard of the popular hit game among us? 
                    It's a really cool game where one to three imposters 
                    try to kill off the crewmates, while the crew has to 
                    finish their tasks or vote off the imposters to 
                    win. It's five dollars on Steam and other consoles 
                    but it is free on App Store and Google Play.
